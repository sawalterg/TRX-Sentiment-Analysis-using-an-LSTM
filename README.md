Use a RNN-LSTM network to predict price movements of a cryptocurrency using sentiment pulled from the relevent subreddit. 

Part 1.

Pulling the relevent data using the PRAW API for Reddit and CMC for the cryptocurrency price. Merging this data on a CSV file

Part 2.

Using textBlob to perform sentiment analysis on the corpus of text to determine polarity of the sentiment for each post. Then averaging the polarity by day to determine the overall sentiment. 


Part 3. 

Creating a null model using the price of the largest cryptocurrency to determine price for comparison

Part 4.

Designing the architecture for a RNN and inputting the CSV data into the network.
